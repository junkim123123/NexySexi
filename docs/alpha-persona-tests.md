# Alpha Persona Tests

This document contains feedback from 8 different alpha test personas who ran through the Product Analyzer + Conversational Copilot flows.

## Persona P1 – Kevin

1. Scenario
- Quick Scan input used: "pocket size mini blender"
- Whether image upload was used: No (blocked by image generation tool auth issue)
- Whether Conversational mode was used: Attempted, but blocked by UI issue.
- Whether quote was requested: No (blocked by UI issue)

2. Observed flow
- The user was unable to proceed with either the Quick Scan or Conversational Copilot flows.
- Clicks on "Start a free analysis" and "Describe Product with a Conversation" did not trigger any UI changes or navigation.
- The main input field for the Quick Scan was also unresponsive to clicks and typing attempts.

3. Problems and friction
- **UI issues:** Critical interactive elements on the main page are not responding to clicks. This completely blocks the user from starting the core analysis flows.
- **States that felt broken or unclear:** The application appears frozen or broken to the user, as clicks have no effect.

4. Suggestions
- Investigate the click handlers and event propagation on the main page, specifically within the `product-analyzer` component. There might be an overlay preventing clicks, or a JavaScript error that's halting execution.

5. Priority tag
- "Must fix before external alpha"
